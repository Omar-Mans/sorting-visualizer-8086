# 8086 Assembly Sorting Algorithms Visualizer (EMU8086)

An interactive **Sorting Algorithms Visualizer** implemented using **8086 Assembly Language** for **EMU8086**.  
The user can choose between three classic sorting algorithms from a menu and watch the sorting process **step by step**.

---

## ✅ Implemented Algorithms

- Insertion Sort  
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  

All algorithms are:
- Iterative (Non-Recursive)
- In-Place
- Based on comparisons and swaps/shifts

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project demonstrates how **sorting algorithms work at the low-level (CPU & memory)** using:
- Registers
- Memory addressing
- Loops
- Conditional jumps
- DOS interrupts for input/output

It is mainly designed for **educational and academic use**.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive menu to choose the algorithm
- Manual input of:
  - Array size (1–10)
  - Array elements (decimal)
- Step-by-step visualization:
  - Each comparison
  - Each swap / shift
- Display of:
  - The array inside a visual ASCII box
  - Current indices (`i`, `j`, `min`)
- Pause after each step:
